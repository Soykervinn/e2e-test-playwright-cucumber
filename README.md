# <span style="color:black">e2e-test-playwright-cucumber</span>
This is a project where I implemented an integration between Playwright and Cucumber, building a framework to test a web site.

## <span style="color:green">Desing Pattern</span>
The project was built using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The POM is a design pattern that allows you to create an object repository for web UI elements. This design pattern is based on the separation of the test logic from the actual web elements and their actions. Using the POM we are able to establish a clear separation between the test code and the page-specific code, at the same time, it allows us to write more maintainable and reusable code.
